                            <p> Hey Everyone! Welcome to my portfolio. Before entering the UW Bootcamp I have had about as little experience programing as imaginable. I've always been intrigued and curious about it, just didn't think I could. Im excited to have this opportunity. Now more about me outside of class. </p>
                        
                            <p>I'm currently a cook at a restaurant in Seattle with the goal to one day own/operate a food truck.
                            Up until recently I had only worked in the construction industry. I was a roustabout in the Alaskan oilfields for 6 years befere turning to landscape construction. I worked for a small company for two years before starting my own business. My business partner and I succesfully grew our business for three years until I knew it wasnt my end game. I sold and pursued my passion for cooking and traveling, which has in effect led me to programming.  
                            </p>

                            <p>I grew up playing all different sports but as i've gotten older its now mostly golf. Occasionally some basketball and snowboarding. I still have a great time playing video games and always down to read a good book.
